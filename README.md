## Using This Template

Feel free to fork this repo if you want to use it as a starting point for your own blog.

To add a new post / make it your own:

1. Fork the github repo
2. Add an entry for your post in the `posts` array in `app/posts.ts`
3. Create a new folder in `app/` named after your post's slug (e.g., `app/my-post/`).
4. Inside that folder create a `page.tsx` file and import the `BlogPage` component and define the post's metadata (title, author, etc) then write your content within the `<BlogPage>` component tags

enjoy : )
