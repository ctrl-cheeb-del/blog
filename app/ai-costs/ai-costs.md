# AI is only going to get more expensive, not cheaper

Forget the idea that using AI in your dev work is going to be cheap. If you haven't already, it's time to treat AI spending as a core expense, not a nice-to-have you can cheap out on. Thinking powerful AI like Claude 3.7 or Opus is "too expensive" means youre NGMI. You're going to need significant revenue and a dedicated budget.

## Why Your Platform Might Be Holding You Back

You've got to know how to play the game, platforms like Cursor are incentivized to **minimize** your token usage to boost their margins on subscriptions. However on the other hand, the model providers are incentivized to have you **maximize** token usage. This fundamental conflict impacts your results.

Many of these platforms like Cursor, Windsurf, etc offer a convenient entry point, but they often act as a limiter in order to appeal to the masses. These models may even feel less optimised in these IDE environments as they are incredibly powerful when accessed directly with more expensive tools like Claude Code / Codex.

## Corporate Budgeting for Real AI Power
Those low-cost, entry-level AI plans (e.g, £30/month)? They often provide insufficient resources for serious development work. While that budget will cover enough calls for most people, those who want higher quality outputs will require *much* more. Expecting top-tier AI performance from such limited plans is unrealistic, true power requires real investment.

What's the new normal? I think its realistic for in the near future companies should plan for **£50+ per developer, per day**.

That anually comes out to **£13000 a year** per developer

While it may seem counter intuitive to increase every developers pay by this much, the increase in quality of work and amount that can be achieved will improve rapidly since much more can be achieved with fewer people in a shorter time too.
## The Cost of Cheaping Out

Cheaping out on AI usage forces developers into counter-productive behaviours such as: restricting tokens sen by intentionally not including context, using subpar models for complex tasks and more. The frustration and slowdown cost far more than any perceived savings on tokens.

These behaviours means spending more time editing prompts, double-checking outputs, and fixing bugs that they will introduce. You might save small on token usage directly, but waste hours of expensive time compensating for the model's limitations.

## Culture and Competition

Budgeting is only step one in the new AI race for companies. You also need an AI-first culture: encourage experimentation, share successful prompts and workflows, integrate AI seamlessly.

Companies that invest seriously in powerful AI *will* outpace those that don't. These teams can achieve dramatically more, potentially reshaping team structures. If one AI-powered engineer can do the work of several, do you still need the same management overhead and heirarchy?

## The Future is Expensive

With the rise of more and more "AI app builders" the majority will soon be building their own apps and systems but making ones of high quality is going to require large investments.

Soon the costs of using these high quality models will rise as seen with high parameter models like GPT 4.5 and O1 Pro. While these won't become the average persons goto model any day now, planning and utilising will be effective in getting ahead.

Invest now, or risk becoming obsolete.
